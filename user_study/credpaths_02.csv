They were too small so I gave them to my daughter and bought size 7, as I normally wear a 7 and they fit wonderfully. I would say if you have a normal size 7B/medium in other shoes, order a 7 in these. Its too bad, tho, that crocs don't come in half sizes for those who need one.  Have always been put off by crocs as they looked like big sloppy wide clogs. Not so with this Jayna style. Having a narrow heel and wider ball, I was thrilled to find these crocs very stylish yet great fitting. The 3 holes in the comfortable rounded toe keep my feel fairly cool while the sling back holds the shoe on securely and doesn't rub. They are light as a feather and slip on and off easily but don't fall off when walking. They do seem to mold to your feet. I like the massage feel of the nubby foot bed which helps the circulation in my tired numb feet. They feel good even for all day wear. They look great with slacks, skirts, short and even pajamas. I get compliments wherever I go. People cannot believe they are Crocs.  I like this Raspberry color, which is a deep bright pink, more than I anticipated. I have a couple of Spring and Summer outfits they match to a tee. The little flower on the side is a youthful touch, but you can take it off without damaging the shoe.

As I was reading/listening to it I was still doubtful as to how good the book was going to turn out, but OMG!!! I finished the book and I was totally and completely blown away by it! I read a review and they had said it was a masterpiece... How right they were! IT IS a MASTERPIECE!! I am floored and I honestly can not wait for the next installment of Evie. I just can not gush over how amazing this book was. It was slow to start and slow to get moving, but the amount of background and detail she puts into it makes the end that much better. I was so keyed up and on the edge of my seat by the time I hit the last few chapters that once I read the last word I exploded out of my seat in frustration and amazement because I have to wait another year to find out what happens next and because I can't believe she just did that!!! I'm an avid reader and I have not been this excited about a book in a long time. I tell you what, no matter what age you are you will NOT regret buying this book, not at all, it's worth the $9.99 and more. Buy it, you won't be sorry, I promise you that.

As I was reading/listening to it I was still doubtful as to how good the book was going to turn out, but OMG!!! I finished the book and I was totally and completely blown away by it! I read a review and they had said it was a masterpiece... How right they were! IT IS a MASTERPIECE!! I am floored and I honestly can not wait for the next installment of Evie. I just can not gush over how amazing this book was. It was slow to start and slow to get moving, but the amount of background and detail she puts into it makes the end that much better. I was so keyed up and on the edge of my seat by the time I hit the last few chapters that once I read the last word I exploded out of my seat in frustration and amazement because I have to wait another year to find out what happens next and because I can't believe she just did that!!! I'm an avid reader and I have not been this excited about a book in a long time. I tell you what, no matter what age you are you will NOT regret buying this book, not at all, it's worth the $9.99 and more. Buy it, you won't be sorry, I promise you that.

How this happened while eating dinner sitting down I have no idea. There is no way to replace this lacing according to My local shoe store.. as shoes are non returnable for any reason I am out of luck.

I'm gonna wear this pair of shoes for a light hiking in Niagara next week, and I'll update this review afterward.  Edit:I've worn this pair when going on a light hike in Niagara Park and a non-stop two-week city-hopping. On average, I was on my feet for 6-8 hours a day, and these shoes were nothing but a wonder. I've had no complaints whatsoever, and my toes were perfectly fine (usually they got blisters but not this time!).

I am not a fan of YA novels and the only reason I bought this one is because I've been a huge fan of Kresley Cole's for a long time, and I've read everything that she has put out over the years and have absolutely loved it, not sure why I doubted it at all now! As I was reading/listening to it I was still doubtful as to how good the book was going to turn out, but OMG!!! I finished the book and I was totally and completely blown away by it! I read a review and they had said it was a masterpiece... How right they were! IT IS a MASTERPIECE!! I am floored and I honestly can not wait for the next installment of Evie. I just can not gush over how amazing this book was. It was slow to start and slow to get moving, but the amount of background and detail she puts into it makes the end that much better. I was so keyed up and on the edge of my seat by the time I hit the last few chapters that once I read the last word I exploded out of my seat in frustration and amazement because I have to wait another year to find out what happens next and because I can't believe she just did that!!! I'm an avid reader and I have not been this excited about a book in a long time. I tell you what, no matter what age you are you will NOT regret buying this book, not at all, it's worth the $9.99 and more. Buy it, you won't be sorry, I promise you that. And the audio book for it is amazing also!! You won't go wrong there either! Go Kresley!

This is really weird because I hadn't had a chance to run in them yet.. I wore them four times out to socialize. The fourth time out I looked down when My right shoe felt loose and I noticed the lace was unraveled from the shoe. It was the cleanest break.. no fraying just a perfect cut. How this happened while eating dinner sitting down I have no idea. There is no way to replace this lacing according to My local shoe store.. as shoes are non returnable for any reason I am out of luck. So just beware these are going to be very comfy and all for running on trails or hiking, but You might get ten miles out and blow a lace... if You can't tie it off somehow it will be slow going back to point A."" for item ""Salomon Men's XA Pro 3D Ultra 2 GTX Trail Running Shoe"" (with categories ""Shoes""),<br><br>which is similar to&emsp;&emsp;review text: ""I've always worn running shoes when traveling or taking a long walk, and this one didn't disappoint. They stay true to size (I'm size 7.5) and didn't really need breaking in. The ankle cushion was okay, but the back cushion might be higher than your socks (especially if you love short socks like I did). The color was also very similar to the picture. My only crit would be about the length of the laces, but you could always get a longer pair yourself. I'm gonna wear this pair of shoes for a light hiking in Niagara next week, and I'll update this review afterward.  Edit:I've worn this pair when going on a light hike in Niagara Park and a non-stop two-week city-hopping. On average, I was on my feet for 6-8 hours a day, and these shoes were nothing but a wonder. I've had no complaints whatsoever, and my toes were perfectly fine (usually they got blisters but not this time!). Perhaps the back ankle support would be too hard they scratched the skin for some people, but you could always avoid it by wearing thick socks."" for item ""ASICS Women's GEL-Aztec MT Running Shoe"" (with categories ""Shoes""),<br><br>which is the review of&emsp;&emsp;""ASICS Women's GEL-Aztec MT Running Shoe"" (with categories ""Shoes"")<br>","You&emsp;&emsp;rated&emsp;&emsp;""Safariland Low-Ride Universal Belt Loop with 2.5"" Belt Width, Black"" (with categories ""Sports""),<br><br>which is rated by&emsp;&emsp;some user,<br><br>who rated&emsp;&emsp;""SET Tactical Weapon Mount"" (with categories ""Sports"")<br>","You&emsp;&emsp;rated&emsp;&emsp;""Toshiba Canvio USB 3.0 Basics Portable Hard Drive"" (with categories ""PC""),<br><br>which is rated by&emsp;&emsp;some user,<br><br>who rated&emsp;&emsp;""Gospel Library"" (with categories ""Mobile_Apps"")<br>","You&emsp;&emsp;rated&emsp;&emsp;""zeroUV ZV-8025c Retro Matte Black Horned Rim Flash Colored Lens Sunglasses, Black Crimson, 50mm"" (with categories ""Shoes""),<br><br>which is rated by&emsp;&emsp;some user,<br><br>who rated&emsp;&emsp;""Canon Office and Business MX922 All in One Printer, Wireless and mobile printing"" (with categories ""Office Products"")<br>"
