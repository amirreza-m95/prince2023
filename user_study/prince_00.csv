So this might be a good recommendation based on I might want to try a new type of tea.,This is a great recommendation since I recently bought a cord to plug in my receiver but this one would allow me to have a wireless version.,The HDMI cord is usually for computers or tv's.  I haven't seen any phones that use an HDMI cord so I am not sure why that would be recommended.,This is not a good recommendation because it's providing a tank top when I recently purchased a fan.  The two don't seem to go together.,The card game is completely different than the umbrella so it doesn't make sense as a recommendation to me.,This makes complete sense because it's another New Balanace shoe and I just wrote a review about how I enjoy the New Balance shoes in particular.,This might be interesting since I purchased some outdoor cushions that I might be interested in watching the birds so I could see it possibly being useful.,This seems relevant since I have been buying and rating highly other automotive parts so I might be interested in this particular part.  But since it's not the same brand as the other ones I may or may not be interested.,I can see a small relevance since I was buying other types of craft items but it seems a bit too specific that I am not sure it would be relevant to me.,This only partially makes sense because while I am buying something related to basketball I may not like that particular team.,This makes complete sense since I seem to enjoy buying toys that you build.,This seems like a good match because I am buying older type technology stuff and rating it highly that I might be interested in getting a deal on another technology item,These two items don't go together at all.  If I am rating a chimney starter highly it doesn't make sense to recommend an in-ear headphone,These two items are not related at all and do not make sense to be a recommendation for one another.,This makes sense since I seem to be rating other high tech gadgets highly so I might be interested in another type of gadget.,This is a complete match since I just rated a screen protector for an iPhone 6 that I might be interested in getting a case too.,I am not sure these two items really go together.  They might be a match because I am looking at home type stuff but overall I would say not a high quality match.,This makes sense because I just rated a software that most people use (tax software).  Another software that most people use is antivirus so it makes sense to offer that as a recommendation.,These two items do not go together at all.  It doesn't even make sense why I would be recommended to buy a philosophy book after rating a food processor highly.,"<span style=""font-size:97%;""><strong>Action1</strong></span>: You<span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>rated highly<span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>""Cuisinart CCO-50N Deluxe Electric Can Opener, White"" (with categories ""Kitchen"")","<span style=""font-size:97%;""><strong>Action1</strong></span>: You<span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>wrote review<span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>review text: &nbsp;""This is one of my favorite black teas already in a bag. It has a deep, dark color, and a rich, strong flavor; yet still mellow. This tea can handle steeping for a while without getting bitter like some bag teas.<br /><br />My sense of taste is very strong, so usually I only steep the tea for a minute or two before it starts to taste bitter to me. This one can steep for longer without having to worry about bitterness so much. Don't get me wrong, if left to sit for too long, or too high a temperature, it will get bitter on you, but so will most any off the shelf tea.<br /><br />To me, this tea embodies what a black tea should be. Strong, dark, aromatic, and robust. A very pleasant drinking experience. I usually put cream in my tea, and a bit of raw sugar or molasses.

I always have it plugged in so I can't comment on the battery life too much though I didn't have it plugged in when I first got it and the full charge lasted about 8 hours.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's a good product and it comes with some neat accessories. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because I feel they could have added a clip on there for relatively cheap.
