They were too small so I gave them to my daughter and bought size 7, as I normally wear a 7 and they fit wonderfully. I would say if you have a normal size 7B/medium in other shoes, order a 7 in these. Its too bad, tho, that crocs don't come in half sizes for those who need one.  Have always been put off by crocs as they looked like big sloppy wide clogs. Not so with this Jayna style. Having a narrow heel and wider ball, I was thrilled to find these crocs very stylish yet great fitting. The 3 holes in the comfortable rounded toe keep my feel fairly cool while the sling back holds the shoe on securely and doesn't rub. They are light as a feather and slip on and off easily but don't fall off when walking. They do seem to mold to your feet. I like the massage feel of the nubby foot bed which helps the circulation in my tired numb feet. They feel good even for all day wear. They look great with slacks, skirts, short and even pajamas. I get compliments wherever I go. People cannot believe they are Crocs. I like this Raspberry color, which is a deep bright pink, more than I anticipated. I have a couple of Spring and Summer outfits they match to a tee. The little flower on the side is a youthful touch, but you can take it off without damaging the shoe.
