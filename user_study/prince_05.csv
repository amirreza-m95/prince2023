This is only because Pentax has raised their annual quota to a ridiculous number, so nobody will carry it in-store. So, I decided to give it a try and order it.    I've had this camera for about three months now and I really like it. It takes fantastic pictures and is easy to use the automatic function. I have not yet had time to sit and play with the manual function so I can't comment on that, but I would assume that it works well since the rest of the camera does.     The only thing I don't like is that if you're not in a well lit area like a concert, for example, the pictures don't come out so great. I went to a concert the other night and had my camera on stage mode first and they were moving too fast for me to use it, so I switched to sport mode. I'm not sure why but they were still REALLY blurry. The only clear pictures I got were when they stopped moving, and I was very disappointed with that.

I am a musician and have a very large and elaborate music system as well.  The Sonos system in my house for my family is as if sent from heaven.  SIMPLE, SIMPLE, SIMPLE and sounds very good.  In my world &#34;very good&#34; does not equal excellent, but these speakers raise the bar for the average listener.  I would say comparable to that of a Bose wave radio.  It does have a great punch at the default settings, however, under settings there is sound equalization.  Also placement has a lot to do with it.  If the unit is on a &#34;box&#34; type stand like a night stand or other wood cabinet, the bass is much more enhanced.  If the speaker unit is on a glass table top or granite counter top, the bass is reduced.  This is true with all speaker enclosures.  As far as setup and the software update,  You pull it out of the box, plug it in, open the control app on your phone and add a Sonos device.  Follow the 1 line of instructions, push the buttons and wait about 30 seconds The screen will say it needs an update, press &#34;ok&#34;, wait 1 min and you are done.  True story...I had to get to the bathroom from all the coffee I had drank, when I pulled into the drive way a new Sonos device had been delivered.  I grabbed it, took it in the house, opened it and had it playing in less than 5 min and continued on to use the restroom that I so urgently needed.
