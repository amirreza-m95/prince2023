It has a deep, dark color, and a rich, strong flavor; yet still mellow. This tea can handle steeping for a while without getting bitter like some bag teas.<br /><br />My sense of taste is very strong, so usually I only steep the tea for a minute or two before it starts to taste bitter to me. This one can steep for longer without having to worry about bitterness so much. Don't get me wrong, if left to sit for too long, or too high a temperature, it will get bitter on you, but so will most any off the shelf tea.<br /><br />To me, this tea embodies what a black tea should be. Strong, dark, aromatic, and robust. A very pleasant drinking experience. I usually put cream in my tea, and a bit of raw sugar or molasses. Both compliment this tea very well."" for item ""Twinings"" (with categories ""Grocery""),<br><br>which is similar to&emsp;&emsp;review text: ""Very tasty, not too finicky tea. I have overbrewed a few times and even then did not have to suffer the bitter wrath of tannins. Wonderful to drink black, or with a splash of milk and sweetener.  I use a tea strainer that allows loose tea to be used much the same as a teabag, and when I've used this tea with the strainer there has been more residue left in the teapot than with other loose teas. This may be due to more powdering of the tea.

I always have it plugged in so I can't comment on the battery life too much though I didn't have it plugged in when I first got it and the full charge lasted about 8 hours.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's a good product and it comes with some neat accessories.

It has a deep, dark color, and a rich, strong flavor; yet still mellow. This tea can handle steeping for a while without getting bitter like some bag teas.<br /><br />My sense of taste is very strong, so usually I only steep the tea for a minute or two before it starts to taste bitter to me. This one can steep for longer without having to worry about bitterness so much. Don't get me wrong, if left to sit for too long, or too high a temperature, it will get bitter on you, but so will most any off the shelf tea.<br /><br />To me, this tea embodies what a black tea should be.
