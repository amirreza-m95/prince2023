This is only because Pentax has raised their annual quota to a ridiculous number, so nobody will carry it in-store. So, I decided to give it a try and order it.    I've had this camera for about three months now and I really like it. It takes fantastic pictures and is easy to use the automatic function. I have not yet had time to sit and play with the manual function so I can't comment on that, but I would assume that it works well since the rest of the camera does.     The only thing I don't like is that if you're not in a well lit area like a concert, for example, the pictures don't come out so great. I went to a concert the other night and had my camera on stage mode first and they were moving too fast for me to use it, so I switched to sport mode. I'm not sure why but they were still REALLY blurry. The only clear pictures I got were when they stopped moving, and I was very disappointed with that.     Other than that one thing, this camera is great and is definitely worth the buy."" for item ""Pentax X70 12MP CCD Digital Camera with 24x Optical Triple Shake Reduction Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD"" (with categories ""Camera""),<br><br>which is similar to&emsp;&emsp;review text: ""I love this camera.

I fell in a river with the replacement camera last month. Water got in the camera. It still works but the internal lens got muddy so it doesn't work well. I just bought exactly the same camera. Why? The pictures are beautiful. The image isn't quite as sharp as a Canon but the colors are amazing. This is my camera for the backcountry, especially for backpacking. It fits in my pocket easily. The lens is internal so I don't have to worry about sand. I can take the camera out of my pocket, open it, take a phenomenal photo, close the camera and put it back in my pocket - all with one hand. I looked at &#34;rugged&#34; cameras this time - but I found this one for $49.99 (including shipping) on eBay so I'm sticking with it.

I am a musician and have a very large and elaborate music system as well.  The Sonos system in my house for my family is as if sent from heaven.  SIMPLE, SIMPLE, SIMPLE and sounds very good.  In my world &#34;very good&#34; does not equal excellent, but these speakers raise the bar for the average listener.  I would say comparable to that of a Bose wave radio.  It does have a great punch at the default settings, however, under settings there is sound equalization.  Also placement has a lot to do with it.  If the unit is on a &#34;box&#34; type stand like a night stand or other wood cabinet, the bass is much more enhanced.  If the speaker unit is on a glass table top or granite counter top, the bass is reduced.  This is true with all speaker enclosures.  As far as setup and the software update,  You pull it out of the box, plug it in, open the control app on your phone and add a Sonos device.  Follow the 1 line of instructions, push the buttons and wait about 30 seconds The screen will say it needs an update, press &#34;ok&#34;, wait 1 min and you are done.  True story...I had to get to the bathroom from all the coffee I had drank, when I pulled into the drive way a new Sonos device had been delivered.  I grabbed it, took it in the house, opened it and had it playing in less than 5 min and continued on to use the restroom that I so urgently needed.  All &#34;plug and play&#34; devices should take a lesson from Sonos, it is an amazingly simple system."" for item ""SONOS P3 Color"" (with categories ""Electronics""),<br><br>which is similar to&emsp;&emsp;review text: ""Quick, easy set up. The subwoofer connected wirelessly easily and quickly to the main sound bar. Sound is definitely a step up from the TV. TV does have good built in sound but this bar with the subwoofer adds a whole different dimension. Plenty of volume from the unit. Our living room is about 17' x 24', open plan, and it certainly fills it with sound with plenty to spare. Have had no bluetooth connection problems playing music from our iPads and iPhones. We did not attach sound bar to the wall. Instead we have it on a credenza underneath the TV at about 36&#34; height. Am using the &#34;tripods&#34; underneath it. Let me explain they are not really tripods but small angled risers that lift the bar about 1.25&#34;. Look much better than any &#34;tripods&#34; would.  PROS: sound, volume, bass, wireless subwoofer, packaged well. Remote has separate volume controls for sound bar and subwoofer. CONS: Tried to use optical cable hook-up. Cable would not stay plugged into sound bar, just kept falling out. Am using the auxiliary input. Manual could be a little more clear, but still, easy to figure out.  ONE RECOMMENDATION: They suggest putting the subwoofer in a corner to increase the bass. I found this to be a little boomy and not to carry well across the room. Instead, I placed it behind the couch, center of the room with the speaker facing the back of the couch instead of the wall. Now it's perfect! Still great bass without sounding boomy and it fills all the room.  Everything sounds so much better. Have been watching HBO's &#34;The Pacific&#34; mini-series, now that gives this a good workout! Very happy with this purchase. I shopped long and hard looking at everything from SONOS to Bose and everything in between. I kept coming back to this brand.  The only reason I do not give this five stars is because of the optical cable problem. Based on what I've read of this company's customer service though.

This is only because Pentax has raised their annual quota to a ridiculous number, so nobody will carry it in-store. So, I decided to give it a try and order it.    I've had this camera for about three months now and I really like it. It takes fantastic pictures and is easy to use the automatic function. I have not yet had time to sit and play with the manual function so I can't comment on that, but I would assume that it works well since the rest of the camera does.     The only thing I don't like is that if you're not in a well lit area like a concert, for example, the pictures don't come out so great. I went to a concert the other night and had my camera on stage mode first and they were moving too fast for me to use it, so I switched to sport mode. I'm not sure why but they were still REALLY blurry. The only clear pictures I got were when they stopped moving, and I was very disappointed with that.     Other than that one thing, this camera is great and is definitely worth the buy."" for item ""Pentax X70 12MP CCD Digital Camera with 24x Optical Triple Shake Reduction Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD"" (with categories ""Camera""),<br><br>which is similar to&emsp;&emsp;review text: ""I love this camera. I bought my first TX-7 in May 2010. I dropped it in a parking lot and it got run over in fall 2012. I replaced it with exactly the same camera. I fell in a river with the replacement camera last month. Water got in the camera. It still works but the internal lens got muddy so it doesn't work well. I just bought exactly the same camera. Why? The pictures are beautiful. The image isn't quite as sharp as a Canon but the colors are amazing. This is my camera for the backcountry, especially for backpacking. It fits in my pocket easily. The lens is internal so I don't have to worry about sand. I can take the camera out of my pocket, open it, take a phenomenal photo, close the camera and put it back in my pocket - all with one hand. I looked at &#34;rugged&#34; cameras this time - but I found this one for $49.99 (including shipping) on eBay so I'm sticking with it.

I am a musician and have a very large and elaborate music system as well.  The Sonos system in my house for my family is as if sent from heaven.  SIMPLE, SIMPLE, SIMPLE and sounds very good.  In my world &#34;very good&#34; does not equal excellent, but these speakers raise the bar for the average listener.  I would say comparable to that of a Bose wave radio.  It does have a great punch at the default settings, however, under settings there is sound equalization.  Also placement has a lot to do with it.  If the unit is on a &#34;box&#34; type stand like a night stand or other wood cabinet, the bass is much more enhanced.  If the speaker unit is on a glass table top or granite counter top, the bass is reduced.  This is true with all speaker enclosures.  As far as setup and the software update,  You pull it out of the box, plug it in, open the control app on your phone and add a Sonos device.  Follow the 1 line of instructions, push the buttons and wait about 30 seconds The screen will say it needs an update, press &#34;ok&#34;, wait 1 min and you are done.  True story...I had to get to the bathroom from all the coffee I had drank, when I pulled into the drive way a new Sonos device had been delivered.  I grabbed it, took it in the house, opened it and had it playing in less than 5 min and continued on to use the restroom that I so urgently needed.  All &#34;plug and play&#34; devices should take a lesson from Sonos, it is an amazingly simple system."" for item ""SONOS P3 Color"" (with categories ""Electronics""),<br><br>which is similar to&emsp;&emsp;review text: ""Quick, easy set up. The subwoofer connected wirelessly easily and quickly to the main sound bar. Sound is definitely a step up from the TV. TV does have good built in sound but this bar with the subwoofer adds a whole different dimension. Plenty of volume from the unit. Our living room is about 17' x 24', open plan, and it certainly fills it with sound with plenty to spare. Have had no bluetooth connection problems playing music from our iPads and iPhones. We did not attach sound bar to the wall. Instead we have it on a credenza underneath the TV at about 36&#34; height. Am using the &#34;tripods&#34; underneath it. Let me explain they are not really tripods but small angled risers that lift the bar about 1.25&#34;. Look much better than any &#34;tripods&#34; would.  PROS: sound, volume, bass, wireless subwoofer, packaged well. Remote has separate volume controls for sound bar and subwoofer. CONS: Tried to use optical cable hook-up. Cable would not stay plugged into sound bar, just kept falling out. Am using the auxiliary input. Manual could be a little more clear, but still, easy to figure out.  ONE RECOMMENDATION: They suggest putting the subwoofer in a corner to increase the bass. I found this to be a little boomy and not to carry well across the room. Instead, I placed it behind the couch, center of the room with the speaker facing the back of the couch instead of the wall. Now it's perfect! Still great bass without sounding boomy and it fills all the room.  Everything sounds so much better. Have been watching HBO's &#34;The Pacific&#34; mini-series, now that gives this a good workout! Very happy with this purchase. I shopped long and hard looking at everything from SONOS to Bose and everything in between. I kept coming back to this brand.  The only reason I do not give this five stars is because of the optical cable problem. Based on what I've read of this company's customer service though.

This is only because Pentax has raised their annual quota to a ridiculous number, so nobody will carry it in-store. So, I decided to give it a try and order it.    I've had this camera for about three months now and I really like it. It takes fantastic pictures and is easy to use the automatic function. I have not yet had time to sit and play with the manual function so I can't comment on that, but I would assume that it works well since the rest of the camera does.     The only thing I don't like is that if you're not in a well lit area like a concert, for example, the pictures don't come out so great. I went to a concert the other night and had my camera on stage mode first and they were moving too fast for me to use it, so I switched to sport mode. I'm not sure why but they were still REALLY blurry. The only clear pictures I got were when they stopped moving, and I was very disappointed with that.     Other than that one thing, this camera is great and is definitely worth the buy."" for item ""Pentax X70 12MP CCD Digital Camera with 24x Optical Triple Shake Reduction Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD"" (with categories ""Camera""),<br><br>which is similar to&emsp;&emsp;review text: ""I love this camera. I bought my first TX-7 in May 2010. I dropped it in a parking lot and it got run over in fall 2012. I replaced it with exactly the same camera. I fell in a river with the replacement camera last month. Water got in the camera. It still works but the internal lens got muddy so it doesn't work well. I just bought exactly the same camera. Why? The pictures are beautiful. The image isn't quite as sharp as a Canon but the colors are amazing. This is my camera for the backcountry, especially for backpacking. It fits in my pocket easily. The lens is internal so I don't have to worry about sand. I can take the camera out of my pocket, open it, take a phenomenal photo, close the camera and put it back in my pocket - all with one hand. I looked at &#34;rugged&#34; cameras this time - but I found this one for $49.99 (including shipping) on eBay so I'm sticking with it.

I am a musician and have a very large and elaborate music system as well.  The Sonos system in my house for my family is as if sent from heaven.  SIMPLE, SIMPLE, SIMPLE and sounds very good.  In my world &#34;very good&#34; does not equal excellent, but these speakers raise the bar for the average listener.  I would say comparable to that of a Bose wave radio.  It does have a great punch at the default settings, however, under settings there is sound equalization.  Also placement has a lot to do with it.  If the unit is on a &#34;box&#34; type stand like a night stand or other wood cabinet, the bass is much more enhanced.  If the speaker unit is on a glass table top or granite counter top, the bass is reduced.  This is true with all speaker enclosures.  As far as setup and the software update,  You pull it out of the box, plug it in, open the control app on your phone and add a Sonos device.  Follow the 1 line of instructions, push the buttons and wait about 30 seconds The screen will say it needs an update, press &#34;ok&#34;, wait 1 min and you are done.  True story...I had to get to the bathroom from all the coffee I had drank, when I pulled into the drive way a new Sonos device had been delivered.  I grabbed it, took it in the house, opened it and had it playing in less than 5 min and continued on to use the restroom that I so urgently needed.  All &#34;plug and play&#34; devices should take a lesson from Sonos, it is an amazingly simple system."" for item ""SONOS P3 Color"" (with categories ""Electronics""),<br><br>which is similar to&emsp;&emsp;review text: ""Quick, easy set up. The subwoofer connected wirelessly easily and quickly to the main sound bar. Sound is definitely a step up from the TV. TV does have good built in sound but this bar with the subwoofer adds a whole different dimension. Plenty of volume from the unit. Our living room is about 17' x 24', open plan, and it certainly fills it with sound with plenty to spare. Have had no bluetooth connection problems playing music from our iPads and iPhones. We did not attach sound bar to the wall. Instead we have it on a credenza underneath the TV at about 36&#34; height. Am using the &#34;tripods&#34; underneath it. Let me explain they are not really tripods but small angled risers that lift the bar about 1.25&#34;. Look much better than any &#34;tripods&#34; would.  PROS: sound, volume, bass, wireless subwoofer, packaged well. Remote has separate volume controls for sound bar and subwoofer. CONS: Tried to use optical cable hook-up. Cable would not stay plugged into sound bar, just kept falling out. Am using the auxiliary input. Manual could be a little more clear, but still, easy to figure out.  ONE RECOMMENDATION: They suggest putting the subwoofer in a corner to increase the bass. I found this to be a little boomy and not to carry well across the room. Instead, I placed it behind the couch, center of the room with the speaker facing the back of the couch instead of the wall. Now it's perfect! Still great bass without sounding boomy and it fills all the room.  Everything sounds so much better. Have been watching HBO's &#34;The Pacific&#34; mini-series, now that gives this a good workout! Very happy with this purchase. I shopped long and hard looking at everything from SONOS to Bose and everything in between. I kept coming back to this brand.  The only reason I do not give this five stars is because of the optical cable problem. Based on what I've read of this company's customer service though.
