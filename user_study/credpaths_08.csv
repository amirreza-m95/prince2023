I am only using the front 3 speakers and sub woofer as my surrounds are in-ceiling. What can I say... audio clarity is excellent and having a separate center really helps with separating dialog from other sound effects. The speakers can put out a surprisingly high volume before experiencing any distortion and are complemented well by the small sub.  As a bonus, they also look very good and sit nicely mounted on the wall, barely extending beyond my low-profile mounted LCD. I've mounted them using the VideoSecu MS40B4 WN3 (the ones with the 1/4&#34; 20 thread) and they fit perfectly.
