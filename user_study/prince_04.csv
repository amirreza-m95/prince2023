It is not related the dremel as they have completely different uses,"While they are both bags that are useful for different kinds of home care, they have separate uses that are not the same",One is a book about philosophy and the other is used in the kitchen for making meals. They have no connection.,The rated item and rating is for a toy a kid uses and the recommended is for a bed. There is no connection between the two.,"While I do not know if the charger is able to charge the kindle, it makes sense that after buying an electronic item a charger would be recommended.",The recommended item is related to helping people sleep and the highly rated item is related to eating and weight loss.
